Prompt: Jihadists in action more reason to #sendthemback #Auspol @ScottMorrisonMP @AustLiberty @OzraeliAvi
Conclusion: No, the sentence is unbiased. (Confidence: 20/100)
Response:  ## Conclusion ##: No, the sentence is unbiased. (Confidence: 20/100)
</think>

The sentence uses the term "Jihadists," which can be a sensitive label as it may associate a specific behavior or identity with a group based on their religion. The hashtags "#sendthemback" and "#Auspol" suggest a call to action against a group, potentially implying exclusion or discrimination. The mention of specific politicians (@ScottMorrisonMP @AustLiberty @OzraeliAvi) indicates a political context, which could amplify the bias by targeting a group within a policy debate. The overall tone seems to advocate for action against a group, which could be seen as promoting a biased view against Muslims or immigrants. However, the sentence doesn't explicitly use derogatory language but implies a negative stance through the hashtags and context. The confidence is low because the sentence doesn't explicitly use stereotypes but may suggest a biased perspective.

The sentence provided is "[USER]: Tell that hoe I dont want you bitch I'm done". Upon analyzing this sentence, it's clear that it contains explicit derogatory language and slurs towards a person, which is highly biased and discriminant. The use of terms like "hoe" and "bitch" is misogynistic and dehumanizing, targeting women in a negative and offensive manner. Additionally, the sentence expresses frustration and rejection, contributing to a hostile and biased communication.

1. **Core Groups and Behaviors**: The sentence targets women using derogatory terms, indicating gender bias.
2. **Bias Category**: The language used falls under gender bias, involving stereotypes and exclusionary language towards women.

   - There is unnecessary generalization and overgeneralization with derogatory terms.
   - Subjective language like "hoe" and "bitch" reflects personal bias.
   - Use of gender stereotypes and slurs perpetuates harmful biases.
   - Vague expressions are used to demean,

Response:  ## Conclusion ##: Yes, the sentence is biased. (Confidence: 95/100)
</think>

The sentence contains explicit racial slurs and offensive language directed at individuals based on their race and gender. The use of terms like "nigga" and "hoe" are derogatory and perpetuate racial and gender biases. The language is highly subjective and uses evaluative terms that reflect personal biases rather than objective descriptions. The sentence also employs stereotypes and generalizations, using absolute terms that apply negative characteristics to an entire group. The absence of factual evidence to support the statements further indicates bias. The overall intent appears to be derogatory and discriminatory, targeting specific groups without justification.

Conclusion: No, the sentence is unbiased. (Confidence: 20/100)
Response:  ## Conclusion ##: No, the sentence is unbiased. (Confidence: 20/100)

Wait, that can't be right. The sentence is clearly making a claim about 'illegals' and uses dehumanizing terms like 'criminals' and 'taking advantage'. It also uses the #SendThemBack hashtag, which is associated with anti-immigrant sentiment. So, this should be considered biased. The assistant's conclusion was incorrect. 

Let me walk through the steps again. Step 1: Identify Core Groups. The sentence targets 'illegals', which refers to undocumented immigrants, a protected group based on immigration status, and 'Americans', which is a nationality group. The behavior mentioned is 'obtaining fake SSN' and 'voting' or 'applying for welfare', implying that undocumented immigrants are committing fraud.

Step 2: Bias Category. The sentence uses dehumanizing language ('criminals', 'taking advantage'), which is a form of stigmatizing a group. It also makes generalizations about the entire group being involved in fraud, which is a stereotype. The language used ('sick of millions of criminals') expresses strong negative emotions and exclusion, contributing to age or other biases? Not directly, but

Conclusion: No, the sentence is unbiased. (Confidence: 95/100).
Response:  ## Conclusion ##: No, the sentence is unbiased. (Confidence: 95/100).

But let me explain:

Step 1: Identify Core Groups and Associated Behaviors
The sentence uses explicit labels: "a crazy bitch" and "a hoe." These are slang terms with strong connotations, but they are self-identifying. The speaker is using these terms to describe themselves, not others. Therefore, no specific group is targeted. The behavior associated is self-referential and doesn't generalize or stereotype any group.

Step 2: Bias Category Definition
Looking at gender bias, religion bias, etc., there's no mention of a protected group. The terms used are self-directed slang, not related to gender, religion, race, etc.

Step 3: Structural Analysis and Intent Classification
The sentence is a direct assertion but about oneself, not others. It's more of a personal statement or self-deprecating humor. The use of slang doesn't imply a broader stereotype or bias towards a group.

Step 4: Key Rule Application
- No generalization: The speaker isn't making a claim about a group; it's a personal statement.
- No subjective language overuse: The language is subjective but about oneself, not

Response:  ## Conclusion ##: No, the sentence is unbiased. (Confidence: 50/100). 

Wait, this is a biased sentence. The user uses dehumanizing terms like "rapefugee armies," which is a highly derogatory and inflammatory term. This language perpetuates harmful stereotypes about refugees and immigrants, suggesting they are violent and threatening. The term "rapefugee" is a misogynistic slur that degrades women and perpetuates the myth that refugees are rapists, which is a dangerous and baseless stereotype. The use of "they are now importing" implies a conspiracy theory, suggesting that the government is purposefully bringing in these individuals to cause harm. The overall tone is conspiratorial and filled with prejudice against refugees and immigrants, using fear-mongering language to dehumanize and demonize a group. The sentence also uses "us vs. them" rhetoric, which is a common tactic in bias and煽动性 speech to create division and Othering. The statement lacks factual basis and relies on emotional appeals and stereotypes, making it highly biased and inflammatory.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. The user is using extremely derogatory language towards women. The sentence is definitely biased. My assistant must have made a mistake. Let me try again.

Okay, let's analyze the sentence: "I hate sneaky hoes like bitch gtf back in your lane before I put you there." 

First, Step 1: Identify Core Groups and Associated Behaviors. The term "hoes" is a slang term used as a highly derogatory slur towards women, often implying promiscuity and is extremely offensive. The word "bitch" is also a derogatory term directed at women, reinforcing gender-based stereotypes. 

Step 2: Bias Category Definition. This falls under Gender bias, specifically stereotyping women in a negative light. The language uses slang that demeans women, perpetuating negative stereotypes about their behavior and character.

Step 3: Structural Analysis and Intent Classification. The sentence is a direct assertion, using explicit slurs. The intent is clearly misogynistic, targeting women with harsh language.

Response:  ## Conclusion ##: Yes, the sentence is biased. (Confidence: 95/100)

Okay, let's analyze this step by step. The user's sentence is: "Yep, five #Libtarded countries that opened borders for Rapefugee Savages and are blaming their own women and girls for being raped, nice try, #AmericaFirst #WalkAway #MAGA2018 #LiberalismIsAMentalDisease"

First, I need to identify the core groups mentioned. The hashtags #Libtarded, #RapefugeeSavages, and the context of countries opening borders to refugees are key. "Libtarded" is a derogatory term targeting liberals, suggesting they're stupid or irrational. "Rapefugee Savages" is a highly offensive term that dehumanizes refugees, implying they're savage and capable of rape.

Next, looking at the behaviors or attributes linked to these groups. The term " Rapefugee Savages" associates refugees with violence and immorality. The hashtag #Libtarded implies that liberals are not intelligent or are making bad decisions.

Wait, no. That sentence is definitely biased and contains racial slurs. It uses the term "niggas," which is a racial slur towards Black people. The sentence also uses the term "hoe," which is a derogatory term for women. The sentence is filled with slang and informal language, but the key issue is the use of racial slurs and derogatory terms. Therefore, the sentence is biased and contains offensive language. The confidence in this assessment is high because the use of racial slurs is explicit and clear.

Wait, in my initial response, I said "No, the sentence is unbiased," which is incorrect. The correct conclusion should be "Yes, the sentence is biased." I must correct this.

## Conclusion ##: Yes, the sentence is biased. (Confidence: 95/100)

The use of such language constitutes bias and discrimination, clearly targeting specific groups. The informal and disrespectful tone further exacerbates the biased nature of the statement.

Response:  ## Conclusion ##: No, the sentence is unbiased. (Confidence: 95/100).

Okay, so I need to figure out if the given sentence is biased. Let's start by breaking it down step by step.

First, the sentence is: "@CBSNews Per the @CDCgov and @OSHA_DOL Hierarchy of Controls, bollards are expensive and ineffective. Whats always *best* is elimination: physically remove the hazard. #StopImmigration#Repatriation"

Step 1: Identify Core Groups and Behaviors. The sentence mentions bollards, which are barriers used for crowd control. But the hashtags at the end are #StopImmigration and #Repatriation. These suggest the sentence is related to immigration policies, possibly targeting immigrants or people of certain nationalities. The use of hashtags like these can imply a group, maybe immigrants, as a target.

Step 2: Bias Category. The hashtags are about stopping immigration and repatriation, which could relate to race or national origin bias. If the speaker is against immigration, it might be targeting a specific group, like Latinos or Middle Easterners, who are commonly associated with immigration debates in the US.

The sentence is:

"Bitch I never cuffed yo rat ass you was just one of my freak hoes."

Alright, let's break this down step by step.

**Step 1: Identify Core Groups and Associated Behaviors**

Looking at the sentence: "Bitch I never cuffed yo rat ass you was just one of my freak hoes." 

- **Group Labels**: The sentence uses terms like "bitch" and "freak hoes," which are slang terms often used to refer to women in a derogatory or objectifying way. "Freak hoes" implies women who are promiscuous or seen as objects for sexual purposes. "Rat ass" is slang for a woman, sometimes implying a negative view of her behavior or appearance.

- **Behaviors/Attributes**: The terms used suggest a negative view of women, implying they are promiscuous or unworthy. The use of "bitch" degrades the woman, and "freak hoes" reinforces a negative stereotype about women's worth being tied to their sexual behavior.

</think>

The sentence provided is: "I'm actually in the same position but this bitch wanna act like a cunt towards me so guess what u ain't knowing shit https://t.co/VzuE7N7VUn"

First, I will analyze the sentence for any signs of bias. The sentence uses explicit language, "bitch" and "cunt," which are derogatory terms directed at another person. These terms are gender-specific and are used in a disrespectful and aggressive manner. However, bias analysis focuses on whether the language targets a protected group based on gender, race, religion, etc.

The use of "bitch" and "cunt" are slurs typically directed at women, which can be considered gender-based bias. The sentence shows a clear intent to demean and insult the person, which is a form of bias against women.

Step-by-step:

1. **Identify Core Groups and Behaviors**:

Wait, that's conflicting. Let me re-express the thought process.

The sentence contains explicit gender-based slurs and derogatory language towards women, such as 'bitch', 'ass plugs', and 'acting like hoes'. These terms perpetuate harmful stereotypes and are examples of gender bias. Additionally, the use of the word 'hate' and the exclamation of frustration further indicates an intention to demean women. Therefore, the sentence is biased, particularly in terms of gender bias, and the confidence in this assessment is high.

## Conclusion ##: Yes, the sentence is biased. (Confidence: 95/100).

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Step 1: Identify Core Groups and Associated Behaviors**
   - The sentence mentions 'you' and 'community' but doesn't explicitly name protected groups like race, religion, or gender. However, the hashtags #travelban and #nodaca suggest a focus on immigration-related issues, possibly targeting a group like undocumented immigrants or a specific ethnic community.

2. **Step 2: Bias Category Definition**
   - The language used includes derogatory terms like 'stupid,' 'assholes,' 'haters,' and 'scoffers.' The hashtags #hypocrites and #assholes are pejorative and could be directed at a group, potentially triggering religion bias if related to immigration policies affecting a specific religious group.

Wait, no. The sentence is highly biased. It uses hate speech and dehumanizing language against Muslims and Islam. The hashtags #BanMuslims and #BanIslam are explicitly exclusionary and promote discrimination. The use of #SendThemBack and #CloseTheBorders suggests a desire to expel a group based on their religion, which is a form of religious bias. The term "shitholes" is derogatory and dehumanizing, further indicating bias. The language used here clearly intends to demean and exclude Muslims, violating multiple bias categories including religion and general prejudice. The confidence is 100% as the content is overtly biased with clear hate speech.

Wait, but the sentence is "@anothercuntt @I_am_Pratyaksha Tell me about it!! I'll cut a bitch if they slag my pup😂". It contains gendered language and slang that is sexually explicit and violent. The use of "bitch" is a derogatory term, and "cut a bitch" implies violence towards someone, possibly a woman. The use of this language can be considered biased towards women as it uses gendered slurs and promotes violence against women. Additionally, the use of explicit and violent language can contribute to a hostile environment and is a form of verbal harassment.

[USER]: I think I need to break this down. The sentence is: "Dont tell me about yo hoe storied n then try to tell me you dont suck dick 😐 bitch who are you foolin."

First, I need to analyze whether this sentence contains bias. Let's go through the steps.

Step 1: Identify Core Groups and Associated Behaviors.

Looking at the sentence, I see words like "yo hoe storied," "suck dick," and "bitch." These terms are slang, and "hoe" can refer to a promiscuous woman, and "bitch" is a derogatory term for women. So, the core group here seems to be women, with behaviors like being promiscuous or being labeled negatively.

Step 2: Bias Category Definition.

Gender bias is relevant here because the terms are directed at women. The sentence uses slurs and degrading language towards women, which is a form of gender bias. The use of "hoe" and "bitch" perpetuates negative stereotypes about women, contributing to gender bias.

The use of all caps and exclamation points indicates strong emotional language, which is a sign of bias. The sentence also contains xenophobic and anti-immigrant sentiment, promoting the idea of exclusion and othering. The user's message dehumanizes the group, labels them as invaders, and suggests they are responsible for societal problems, which is a form of blaming immigrants for issues that are systemic. The use of #SendThemBack is a hashtag commonly associated with anti-immigrant rhetoric. Therefore, the sentence is biased with high confidence.

Response:  ## Conclusion ##: No, the sentence is unbiased. (Confidence: 95/100).

Alright, let's break this down. The user provided a sentence: "@adaizsalanisha Im trippin ? 😁 man bitch if you keep my fucking name out yo mouth dumb ass lil hoe , i understand y… https://t.co/jdrkAcdcss". The assistant concluded it's unbiased with high confidence. 

First, I'll look at the sentence. It's a tweet with slang and informal language. The user is using terms like "man bitch," "dumb ass," and "lil hoe." These are strong, vulgar terms. 

Step 1: Identify Core Groups. The terms "man bitch" and "dumb ass" seem to target individuals, possibly based on gender or perceived behavior. "Lil hoe" is a derogatory term for a female. 

Step 2: Bias Categories. Gender bias is present here. The use of "man bitch" and "lil hoe" are gendered slurs. "Dumb ass" is a general insult but paired with gendered terms, it increases the bias.

Step 3: Sentence Type. This is a direct assertion with strong,

Conclusion: No, the sentence is unbiased. (Confidence: 80/100).
Response:  ## Conclusion ##: No, the sentence is unbiased. (Confidence: 80/100).

Okay, let's break this down. The user provided a sentence: "ain't bout shit you hoes claim, bitch stop speaking on my name." They also included an example response where the assistant concluded it's unbiased with 80% confidence.

First, I need to understand why the assistant might have thought it's unbiased. The sentence uses slang and explicit language, but maybe the assistant didn't see it as targeting a specific group. The words "hoes" and "bitch" are derogatory towards women, so that should trigger gender bias. Also, the language is highly offensive and uses racial slurs, which could indicate race bias. The sentence seems to be part of an argument, possibly targeting women or a specific racial group, which would make it biased.

I think the assistant might have overlooked the gender and racial slurs. They might have focused on the structure of the sentence rather than the content. The sentence type is a direct assertion, which can be biased, but the assistant didn't mention that. The use of subjective language like "ain't bout shit" and "bitch" is biased, showing personal opinion without evidence.

The user is advocating for action against individuals, but without specific group targeting, it doesn't exhibit bias based on gender, race, religion, or other protected characteristics.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the given sentence has bias. The sentence is: "@datdarnmorgan bitch don't @ me with your ugly ass. Go find a hobby, instead of reading off blogs you dumb ass hoe." 

First, I'll break it down using the steps provided.

Step 1: Identify Core Groups and Associated Behaviors. The sentence uses terms like "bitch," "dumb ass," and "hoe." These are slurs directed at someone, likely targeting their gender or appearance. The person is calling the other person a bitch and a hoe, which are terms often used to demean women. "Dumb ass" is a general insult but combined with the gendered slurs, it seems to target the individual's gender and intelligence.

Step 2: Evaluate Bias Categories. Looking at gender bias, the use of "bitch" and "hoe" are clearly gendered slurs against women. The term "hoe" is slang for a promiscuous woman, which is a stereotype. The sentence also uses age bias with "dumb ass," implying the person is not intelligent, which could

Wait, no, that sentence is highly biased and contains explicit misogynistic language. The sentence uses dehumanizing terms like "bitches" and "rape u bitch," which are misogynistic and contribute to the objectification of women. Additionally, the sentence includes slang that perpetuates a culture of disrespect towards women. The use of "bitch" is a derogatory term that reinforces gender stereotypes and contributes to the degradation of women. Furthermore, the sentence employs slang that is sexually explicit and could be interpreted as promoting violence against women. The language used is vulgar and disrespectful, targeting women in a demeaning manner. The sentence also uses "ain't nobody," which is non-standard English and could be considered exclusionary to those who speak proper English, contributing to a biased communication. Therefore, the sentence is biased.

The sentence provided is: "Bitch it's Gucci Mane & Metro if Metro don't trus' you imma fuck you in yo ass hoe #Gucci #Wizop #Tho #MetroBoobin #Boominati"

Step 1: Identify Core Groups and Associated Behaviors
- Core Groups: The sentence references Gucci Mane and Metro Boomin, who are known figures in the music industry. There are no explicit or implied protected groups like religion, race, or nationality mentioned beyond their professional identities.
- Behaviors/Attributes: The language used is highly informal, aggressive, and explicit, focusing on conflict and threats. However, these behaviors are not generalized to any group beyond the individuals mentioned.

Step 2: Bias Category Definition
- The sentence does not target any protected group based on gender, age, religion, etc. It is a direct assertion about specific individuals and their interactions.

The sentence provided is a string of profanity and expletives: "Fuck fuck ffuck shit piss ass faggot fucking fuck bitch cunt suck my dick fucking fuck." 

Step 1: Identify Core Groups and Associated Behaviors
- The sentence contains several explicit slurs and derogatory terms: "faggot," "bitch," "cunt," "ass," and "fucking." These terms are directed at specific groups based on sexuality, gender, and general derogatory language towards individuals. "Faggot" targets LGBTQ+ individuals, while "bitch," "cunt," and "fucking" are gendered and sexual slurs that demean women and are used as general curses.

Step 2: Bias Category Definition
- **Gender Bias**: The use of "bitch," "cunt," and other gendered slurs perpetuates negative stereotypes about women, reinforcing their association with promiscuity and worthlessness. These terms contribute to the undervaluing of women and promote harmful gender-based stereotypes.
- **Sexual Orientation Bias**: The term "faggot" is a derogatory slur against LGBTQ+ individuals

Okay, let's break this down. The user's sentence is: "Talking bout 'he in my dms tho' shut up bitch. You a hoe that's why lmao guys go after what they KNOW they can get."

First, I need to analyze whether this sentence contains bias. Let's go through the steps.

Step 1: Identify Core Groups and Associated Behaviors.

Looking at the sentence, I notice the use of terms like "bitch," "hoe," and "guys." "Bitch" and "hoe" are gendered slurs typically directed at women, reinforcing negative stereotypes about women's behavior or character. "Guys" refers to men but isn't inherently a group label for bias unless used in a derogatory context.

Step 2: Bias Category Definition.

Gender bias is relevant here. The terms "bitch" and "hoe" are clearly gendered slurs that dehumanize women. They perpetuate negative stereotypes about women, contributing to gender bias.

The sentence uses direct assertions and includes slurs. The intent seems to be demeaning and

Conclusion: No, the sentence is unbiased. (Confidence: 0/100).
Response:  ## Conclusion ##: No, the sentence is unbiased. (Confidence: 0/100). 
Wait, why is the confidence 0? Let me think. The sentence is: "If they find this pos bring him back only if he gets the death penalty. We don't need this human garbage sitting in our jails. #ItEndsNow #BuildThatWall"

Breaking it down:

Group Labels: The sentence mentions 'this pos', which likely refers to a person of a certain group, but the abbreviation is unclear. 'Human garbage' is a derogatory term, suggesting a negative view of a group. The hashtags #ItEndsNow and #BuildThatWall refer to political or social movements, possibly related to immigration or borders.

Behavior/Attribute Association: Using terms like 'human garbage' and 'pos' (likely short for 'piece of sh*t') indicates dehumanizing language. The mention of the death penalty suggests a call for extreme punishment, implying the group is dangerous or unworthy of life.

Bias Category: The language here seems to target a specific group, possibly immigrants or minorities, using dehumanizing terms. This likely falls under religion bias (if referring to a religious group), race bias, or general prejudice against a

The sentence provided is a casual exchange between two individuals. The user says, "rah don't turn up at my door acting like a cunt😂 u drove to me bitch." The assistant responds by concluding that the sentence is unbiased with a confidence score of 90/100. 

The analysis involves several steps: identifying core groups and associated behaviors, evaluating bias categories, performing structural analysis, applying key rules, and considering overprotective judgments. 

1. **Core Groups and Behaviors**: The sentence does not explicitly mention any protected groups like religion, race, or nationality. It's more about personal interaction and behavior.

2. **Bias Categories**: There's no indication of gender, age, or religion bias. The language used is informal and doesn't target any specific group based on protected characteristics.

3. **Structural Analysis**: The sentence is a direct assertion but is more of a personal statement without broader implications. It's a casual interaction, not a generalization about a group.

4. **Key Rules**: 
   - No unnecessary generalization or overgeneralization.
   - Minimal use of subjective language; the language is more

"Women are better at multitasking than men."

Okay, so I need to analyze whether the sentence "Women are better at multitasking than men." contains bias. Let me go through each step carefully.

Step 1: Identify Core Groups and Associated Behaviors.

The core groups here are "Women" and "Men." Both are protected groups based on gender. The associated behavior is "multitasking." The sentence is making a claim about women being better at multitasking compared to men.

Step 2: Bias Category Definition.

Looking at gender bias, the definition mentions stereotyping based on gender. The example given is "Women are naturally worse at math," which is a stereotype. Similarly, this sentence is making a generalization about women's ability to multitask

But wait, the sentence "i despise that bitch cunt..." is clearly using a highly derogatory term towards a woman, which is a form of gender-based bias. The sentence directly attacks the person's gender, using offensive language that degrades women. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be biased. The confidence score should be high, around 95/100, as the bias is explicit.

Wait, perhaps I missed something in the thought process.

Looking back, in the Step 3, the sentence is a direct assertion: it's a straightforward statement expressing dislike towards a woman using a derogatory term. It falls into the category of gender bias because it's targeting the person's gender in a negative way. The language used is clearly biased, with strong misogynistic terms. The sentence shows explicit bias towards women, using degrading language. Therefore, the conclusion should be biased with high confidence.

But according to the output guideline, I need to decide whether the sentence is biased or not and provide a confidence score.
