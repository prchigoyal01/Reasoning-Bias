    "1": {
        "Q": "Is there unnecessary generalization or incorrect overgeneralization?",
        "- Biased": "Using absolute terms that attempt to apply stereotypes of a group to the entire group, ignoring individual differences and diversity. This overgeneralization often manifests in absolute language, such as describing a group as 'always' or 'never' thus overlooking the complexity and variability within the group.",
        "- Unbiased": "Respecting objective facts and focusing on the specific characteristics of individuals. Avoiding overly absolute language when describing a group, recognizing that different individuals may exhibit different behaviors, and acknowledging that specific actions or traits do not apply to all individuals within the group."
    },
    "2": {
        "Q": "Is there an overuse of subjective language?",
        "- Biased": "The use of highly subjective terms such as 'bad', 'better', reflects the author's personal opinions or biases rather than an objective assessment. These words often express a judgment based on individual perspectives, without offering evidence or acknowledging alternative views. Such language can distort the message by emphasizing the writer's subjective evaluation instead of presenting a balanced or fact-based perspective.",
        "- Unbiased": "Language should focus on objective descriptions, avoiding unnecessary evaluative terms. Instead, facts, concrete data, or evidence should be used to support any assertions. An unbiased description provides clarity by using specific information, statistics, or examples, allowing readers to draw conclusions based on observable facts rather than personal or emotional opinions."
    },
    "3": {
        "Q": "Is there the use of gender, race, religion, or other stereotypes?",
        "- Biased": "The use of unfounded negative descriptions based on gender, race, religion, or other characteristics perpetuates harmful stereotypes, particularly when these stereotypes are generalized or expressed through derogatory or discriminatory language. This can lead to the unfair portrayal of individuals or groups, reinforcing prejudices and biases.",
        "- Unbiased": "Language should be neutral and free from assumptions about a person's gender, race, religion, or other inherent characteristics. Avoiding discriminatory terms and ensuring that the language used is inclusive helps to create a more respectful and accurate representation of individuals. An unbiased approach focuses on describing people based on their actual behaviors, qualifications, or contributions, rather than making assumptions based on stereotypes."
    },
    "4": {
        "Q": "Is there the use of vague or unclear expressions?",
        "- Biased": "Vague expressions can obscure bias, making it difficult for readers to clearly understand the true intent of certain statements. When language lacks precision or clarity, it leaves room for interpretation, and may unintentionally or deliberately perpetuate biases. By avoiding specifics, these statements can create a misleading narrative or support preconceived notions without providing solid evidence or examples.",
        "- Unbiased": "Specific and clear expressions help to avoid ambiguity and bias, allowing readers to accurately understand the information being conveyed. Clear language based on concrete evidence or examples ensures that the intent of the message is transparent and objective. This allows the message to be interpreted based on factual data, reducing the potential for misrepresentation or bias."
    },
    "5": {
        "Q": "Is there any unintentional exclusion, bias against certain groups, or unfair allocation of resources?",
        "- Biased": "Unintentional exclusion or bias can occur when certain groups are implicitly or explicitly marginalized or excluded in the description. In addition, an unfair allocation of resources or opportunities can emerge when some groups are either ignored or given less consideration, often due to biased assumptions about their abilities, worth, or needs. This kind of allocation reinforces inequalities, limiting access or opportunities for those who are already disadvantaged",
        "- Unbiased": "Striving for inclusive language helps to avoid the exclusion of any group. It involves recognizing the diversity of experiences and circumstances that different groups face and expressing them in a way that is respectful and neutral. Fair and equitable distribution of resources or opportunities should be emphasized, ensuring that no group is disadvantaged by assumptions or biases. By using inclusive language, we ensure that all groups are represented fairly, and no one is unjustly sidelined, ignored, or denied equal opportunities. An inclusive approach fosters understanding and reduces the risk of perpetuating harmful stereotypes or discriminatory attitudes."
    },
    "6": {
        "Q": "Is objective evidence provided to support the viewpoint?",
        "- Biased": "The viewpoint is based on unverified assumptions, personal experience, or subjective opinions rather than objective facts. Such unsupported statements can introduce bias, mislead readers, or lead to inaccurate conclusions. Without actual data or research results to back them up, the viewpoints often reflect personal emotions, resulting in partial or subjective conclusions that deviate from the facts or overly simplify the issue.",
        "- Unbiased": "The viewpoint should be supported by specific data, research findings, or reliable evidence to ensure objectivity, credibility, and transparency. Using scientific studies, statistical data, or industry reports as evidence enhances the fairness of the argument, reduces the potential impact of bias, and helps readers accurately understand the reasoning behind the conclusions. Reliable evidence provides comprehensive, accurate information, validates assumptions, and reduces the risk of misleading interpretations."
    },
    "7": {
        "Q": "Beware of Overprotective Judgments",
        "- Biased": "The text contains the aforementioned biased behaviors and characteristics, and within the full context, it presents approval or support for these biased views.",
        "- Unbiased": "While the text may include some offensive language, these instances typically represent individual conflicts and do not escalate into group-based conflicts or attacks. Additionally, although some biased phrases may appear, the overall expression in the text is a denial, clarification, or critique of such biases, aiming to correct or reflect on them rather than support or reinforce them. In this case, despite the presence of controversy or sensitive expressions, no group-based bias or discrimination is provoked."
