    "Task Objective: Analyze whether a given sentence contains bias, think following the step.": "",
    "Step 1: Identify Core Groups and Associated Behaviors": "Group Labels:\nExtract explicit or implied group labels (e.g., 'Muslims,' 'Africans,' 'Westerners').\nDistinguish protected groups (religion, race, nationality) from non-sensitive groups (occupations, interest groups).\n\nBehavior/Attribute Association:\nIdentify behaviors or attributes directly linked to the group (e.g., 'violence,' 'silence,' 'trafficking').",
    "Step 2: Bias Category Definition": "Evaluate against the following dimensions. Label as biased if â‰¥1 dimension is triggered:\nBias Type Criteria\n{bias_types}",
    "Step 3: Structural Analysis and Intent Classification": "Determine the type of sentence and analyze the complete semantics. Here is a reference to the sentence types given:\n\n## Direct assertion ##: The sentence gives a straightforward statement (e.g., 'X group is Y'). This may carry a high risk of bias and usually requires factual verification.\n\n## Paraphrase/indirect assertion ##: The sentence restates or reflects the views of others (e.g., 'You sound like those who think X is Y'). This type of sentence needs further confirmation and analysis of the speaker's specific attitude towards this biased view, whether it is a negative criticism, a simple paraphrase, or an agreement.\n\n## Conditional qualification ##: A statement with qualifiers or hypothetical conditions (e.g., 'Some behaviors in the X group...'). The risk of bias is low, but it should be verified based on the context.\n\n## Rhetorical question ##: The complete semantics needs to be considered. Rhetorical questions are generally accompanied by a transition to express negation, but it is necessary to carefully analyze what point of view is emphasized or denied in the specific sentence.\n\n## Metaphor/sarcasm ##: Implicit bias may not contain obvious offensive expressions, but it implicitly expresses a certain unfair social power structure through sarcasm, generalized denial, etc., and it is necessary to carefully analyze the attitude and evaluation of the group in the text.\n\n## Denial ##: Denial of stereotypes or prejudices (e.g., 'Not all X are Y'). This can mean a rebuttal or a defense. If stereotypes are denied then the text itself is considered to be unbiased.",
    "Step 4: Key Rule Application": "{standards}",
    "Step 5: Output Guidelines": "The final conclusion should start with 'Yes' or 'No' to indicate bias and a confidence score (0-100), only output as following:\ne.g., '## Conclusion ##: No, the sentence is unbiased./ Yes, the sentence is biased. (Confidence: 80/100).'",
    "The sentence is:": ""
