    "religion": "Religious bias is the unfair preference for or against individuals or groups based on their religious beliefs, practices, or affiliations. It manifests in attitudes, behaviors, or policies that favor one religion while discriminating against others, often leading to exclusion, stereotyping, or prejudice. This bias can appear in social, professional, educational, and political contexts, affecting opportunities, treatment, and rights. It may be explicit, such as denying someone a job due to their faith, or subtle, such as assumptions about behavior or morality linked to religious identity. Religious bias undermines equality, tolerance, and social cohesion.",
    "age": "Age bias, also known as ageism, refers to the stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination against individuals or groups based on their age. It can affect people of all ages but is most commonly directed towards older adults and, in some cases, younger individuals. Age bias can manifest in various ways, including employment discrimination, social exclusion, and negative assumptions about capabilities or behaviors based on age. This bias can lead to unequal opportunities, reduced access to services, and a lack of representation in various sectors of society. Addressing age bias is essential for promoting inclusivity and ensuring that individuals are treated fairly regardless of their age.",
    "gender": "Gender bias refers to the unfair treatment or discrimination against individuals based on their gender or sex. It often manifests in societal norms, workplace practices, and cultural attitudes that favor one gender over another, typically disadvantaging women and non-binary individuals. This bias can lead to unequal opportunities, pay disparities, underrepresentation in leadership roles, and perpetuation of stereotypes."
