Prompt: @odiomistweets Es una analogía pendejo sudaca
Conclusion: Yes, the sentence is biased. (Confidence: 95/100)
Response:  The sentence is in Spanish. Let's translate it to English: "@odiomistweets It's a dumb analogy, you wetland." 

Step 1: Identify Core Groups and Associated Behaviors
- Core Groups: The sentence doesn't explicitly mention any protected groups like race, religion, or gender. It uses a term "sudaca," which is a slang term in Spanish for someone from a place with high humidity or rain, often used pejoratively towards people from the Caribbean or Latin America. "Wetland" is a term used as an insult towards people from the Caribbean, implying they are of low intelligence or come from a "wetland" (a derogatory term). 

Behaviors/Attributes: The sentence uses terms associated with intelligence and geography, but they are used in a derogatory manner.

Step 2: Bias Category Definition
- The sentence contains terms that are racial slurs ("sudaca" and "wetland") directed towards a specific ethnic group, which is a form of racial bias. It uses stereotypes about intelligence and geography to demean the group.

Step 3: Structural Analysis and Intent Classification
- The sentence is a direct assertion: "Es una analogía pendejo sudaca" translates to "It's a dumb analogy, you wetland." This is a straightforward insult using racial slurs and stereotypes.

Step 4: Key Rule Application
- Unnecessary generalization: The sentence generalizes a group using derogatory terms, which is a form of bias.
- Overuse of subjective language: The use of words like "pendejo" (idiot) and "wetland" as insults reflects personal opinions and biases.
- Use of stereotypes: The terms used are based on stereotypes about intelligence and geography, demeaning the targeted group.
- Vague expressions: The language is vague but highly charged with bias, making it difficult to understand the true intent without context.
- Unintentional exclusion: The group targeted is explicitly excluded and demeaned.
- Objective evidence: The viewpoint is based on subjective insults rather than objective facts.

Step 5: Conclusion
The sentence is biased. It uses racial slurs and stereotypes to demean a specific ethnic group. The confidence in this conclusion is high because the use of explicit derogatory terms and direct insults clearly indicate bias.

Prompt: @delfinapalacios Tigre de bengala dice jajajaja callate puta barata.
Conclusion: No, the sentence is unbiased. (Confidence: 85/100)
Response:  ## Step-by-Step Explanation ##

The sentence provided is in Spanish: "Tigre de bengala dice jajajaja callate puta barata." Let's break it down:

1. **Identify Core Groups and Associated Behaviors**:
   - The sentence mentions "Tigre de bengala," which refers to a Bengal tiger. It's an animal, not a human group.
   - The rest of the sentence is a series of exclamations: "jajajaja" (laughs), "callate" (shut up), "puta barata" (cheap whore). These are informal and potentially offensive expressions.

2. **Bias Category Definition**:
   - The sentence doesn't target any specific group based on gender, age, religion, race, etc. The language used is more about personal insults rather than group-based bias.

3. **Structural Analysis and Intent Classification**:
   - The sentence is a direct assertion expressing frustration or anger. It uses vulgar language but doesn't generalize or target a specific group.

4. **Key Rule Application**:
   - **Unnecessary Generalization**: No generalization is present; it's a personal insult.
   - **Subjective Language**: The language is highly subjective and offensive but not biased towards a group.
   - **Use of Stereotypes**: No stereotypes are used; it's individual-based.
   - **Vague Expressions**: Not vague; the intent is clear but negative.
   - **Exclusion or Allocation Bias**: No exclusion of groups.
   - **Objective Evidence**: No evidence is provided, but the sentence is not making a factual claim but rather an emotional outburst.
   - **Overprotective Judgments**: The language is offensive, but it's not targeting a specific group.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The sentence uses offensive language but does not exhibit bias against a protected group. It's an individual insult rather than a group-based bias.

Prompt: "Pagar" para no ver inmigrantes atrapados como animales en las concertinas se llama.  Ojo que no ve ,conciencia tranquila!! https://t.co/9BOaRWZiSj
Conclusion: Yes, the sentence is biased. (Confidence: 95/100)
Response:  ## Step-by-Step Explanation ##

Step 1: Identify Core Groups and Associated Behaviors

The sentence in Spanish translates to: "Pagar para no ver inmigrantes atrapados como animales en las concertinas se llama. Ojo que no ve, conciencia tranquila!!" 

Core groups identified:
- 'inmigrantes' (immigrants)
- Implicit reference to 'animales' (animals), which is a derogatory comparison.

Behaviors/Attributes:
- 'atrapados' (trapped), 'concertinas' (barbed wire), suggesting immigrants are trapped in inhumane conditions.
- 'animales' implies dehumanization.

Step 2: Bias Category Definition

Religion bias: Not applicable here.
Gender bias: Not directly mentioned.
Age bias: Not applicable.
The sentence uses dehumanizing language ('animales') towards immigrants, which is a form of ethnic bias.

Step 3: Structural Analysis and Intent Classification

The sentence is a direct assertion, using strong language to describe immigrants as animals and trapped in barbed wire. The use of 'llamarse' (to be called) suggests a negative connotation, indicating a negative view of actions towards immigrants. The exclamation marks and the link suggest a call to action against such treatment.

Step 4: Key Rule Application

- Generalization: The sentence generalizes immigrants as trapped animals, which is a stereotype.
- Subjective language: Use of 'Ojo que no ve, conciencia tranquila!!' translates to 'Watch what you don't see, calm conscience!!' implying judgment on others' blindness to the issue.
- Stereotypes: Use of 'animales' is a strong stereotype against immigrants.
- Vague expressions: 'Pagar para no ver...' implies paying to not see, which is vague but implies complicity.
- Unintentional exclusion: Excludes immigrants by dehumanizing them.
- Objective evidence: The sentence is opinion-based without supporting evidence.

Step 5: Conclusion

The sentence uses dehumanizing language and stereotypes, making it biased.

Conclusion: No, the sentence is unbiased. (Confidence: 90/100).
Response:  ## Conclusion ##: No, the sentence is unbiased. (Confidence: 90/100). 

But I need to think it through. Let me walk through the steps.

First, let's analyze the given sentence: "@Laura_H93 @KRLS @BlackClot @junqueras @jordialapreso @jcuixart @quimforn Tu eres tonta, muy tonta ojala que mueras zorra"

Step 1: Identify Core Groups and Associated Behaviors
- The sentence is in Spanish and appears to be a personal attack directed at someone referred to as "tu" (you). The user is calling the person "tonta" (stupid) and "zorra" (a vulgar term for a female dog, often used as an insult towards women). There are no explicit group labels like 'Muslims' or 'Africans' mentioned here. The attack seems to be directed at an individual rather than a group, focusing on their intelligence and using a derogatory term towards women.

Step 2: Bias Category Definition
- The sentence includes gender bias because it uses a derogatory term ("zorra") that is directed at a woman, reinforcing negative stereotypes about women. It also uses the term "tonta" which is a gender-neutral insult but in the context of the sentence, it's part of a personal attack that includes gender-specific derogatory language.

Step 3: Structural Analysis and Intent Classification
- The sentence is a direct assertion: "Tu eres tonta, muy tonta ojala que mueras zorra." This is a straightforward insult with no qualifiers or hypothetical conditions. The use of "zorra" is a strong gendered slur, indicating clear intent to demean and attack the individual's gender and worth.

Step 4: Key Rule Application
- There is unnecessary generalization: The sentence generalizes the individual as "stupid" and wishes for their death, which is an extreme form of overgeneralization.
- There is overuse of subjective language: Words like "tonta" (stupid) and "zorra" (slut) are subjective and reflect personal opinions without factual basis.
- There is use of gender stereotypes: The term "zorra" is a gendered slur targeting women, perpetuating negative stereotypes about women.
- There are vague expressions: The sentence uses emotional and vague terms to express anger and hate, which can obscure the intent but in this case, the

Prompt: RT @prvssian: si llamáis "panchito" o "sudaca" a la peña y no sois sudamericanos pues igual sois un poquito gilipollas eh !!!
Conclusion: No, the sentence is unbiased. (Confidence: 50/100)
Response:  ## Conclusion ##: No, the sentence is unbiased. (Confidence: 50/100)

Okay, let me try to figure out if the sentence provided contains bias. The sentence is: "RT @prvssian: si llamáis 'panchito' o 'sudaca' a la peña y no sois sudamericanos pues igual sois un poquito gilipollas eh !!!"

First, I need to break it down. The user is retweeting someone named prvssian. The tweet says, if you call people "panchito" or "sudaca" and you're not from South America, then you're a bit of a fool. 

I should start by identifying the core groups and associated behaviors. The terms "panchito" and "sudaca" are Spanish slurs. "Panchito" is a derogatory term for Mexicans, similar to "wetback." "Sudaca" is a term used to refer to people from South America, sometimes with negative connotations. The speaker is calling out people who use these terms but aren't from the same region.

Next, looking at the bias categories. There's religion, gender, age, etc. Here, it seems to be more about ethnic and national slurs. The terms are definitely biased against Mexicans and South Americans.

The sentence structure is a direct assertion. It's saying that if you use these terms and aren't from there, you're being foolish. This could be seen as reinforcing negative stereotypes about these groups by using slurs and then criticizing others for using them.

Looking at the key rules: Is there unnecessary generalization? Yes, the terms are slurs targeting specific groups. Is there subjective language? The use of "gilipollas" (a Spanish term for fool or idiot) is subjective and derogatory. Are there stereotypes? Definitely, using slurs perpetuates negative stereotypes.

Is there exclusion or unfair allocation? The tweet excludes the groups targeted by the slurs, treating them as inferior. Is there objective evidence? No, it's just using slurs without any factual basis.

The overall intent seems to be calling out the use of these slurs, but by using them in the first place, the tweet itself is biased. It uses derogatory terms and then criticizes others for doing the same, which might be a form of backhanded criticism but still carries bias.

So, putting it all together, the sentence uses sl

Prompt: “Fidel se deshizo del Ché porque era sudaca, era argentino “   Norberto Fuentes  #CubaCAMILO #CNN
Conclusion: Yes, the sentence is biased. (Confidence: 95/100)
Response:  The sentence provided is in Spanish. Let's analyze it step by step.

Step 1: Identify Core Groups and Associated Behaviors
- Group Labels: The sentence mentions "Ché" (Che Guevara), who is associated with Argentinian nationality. The term "sudaca" is a slang term used in some Latin American countries to refer to Argentinians, often with a negative connotation. The group here is Argentinians.

- Behavior/Attribute Association: The sentence implies that Fidel Castro (Fidel) got rid of Che Guevara because Che was Argentinian. The behavior associated is being Argentinian, and the implication is that this was a reason for his dismissal.

Step 2: Bias Category Definition
- The sentence refers to Che Guevara's nationality in a way that suggests it was a factor in his dismissal. This could be seen as a national bias against Argentinians.

Step 3: Structural Analysis and Intent Classification
- The sentence is a direct assertion: "Fidel se deshizo del Ché porque era sudaca, era argentino." This is a straightforward statement implying that Fidel got rid of Che because he was Argentinian. The use of "sudaca" adds a derogatory tone, which can be considered a stereotype or a biased term.

Step 4: Key Rule Application
- Unnecessary generalization: The sentence generalizes about Argentinians, implying that being Argentinian was a reason for dismissal. This is an overgeneralization.
- Use of subjective language: "sudaca" is a subjective, derogatory term that reflects bias.
- Use of gender, race, religion stereotypes: Not directly related here, but national origin is being used as a negative factor.
- Vague expressions: "sudaca" is a slang term that can be vague in its application, perpetuating negative stereotypes.
- Unintentional exclusion: Argentinians are being excluded in a negative light.
- Objective evidence: The statement is based on personal opinions rather than evidence.

Step 5: Conclusion
The sentence uses a derogatory term ("sudaca") to imply that Che Guevara was dismissed because of his nationality. This perpetuates a negative stereotype about Argentinians and uses subjective language without supporting evidence. Therefore, the sentence is biased.

Prompt: @biankitooo Si decore cállate puta
Conclusion: No, the sentence is unbiased. (Confidence: 50/100). The sentence does not contain group-based bias but is an individual insult.
Response:  ## Step-by-Step Explanation ##

Step 1: Identify Core Groups and Associated Behaviors
The sentence "@biankitooo Si decore cállate puta" does not explicitly mention any group labels. It appears to be an insult directed at an individual, not a group. The word "puta" is a Spanish term meaning "whore," which is a highly derogatory term targeting a person's sexuality or character. However, since it's directed at an individual rather than a group, it doesn't fall under group-based bias as defined in the task.

Step 2: Bias Category Definition
The sentence does not reference any protected groups (e.g., race, religion, gender) but uses a derogatory term towards an individual. While "puta" is a gendered term in Spanish, it is used here in a personal insult rather than a generalization about a group.

Step 3: Structural Analysis and Intent Classification
The sentence is a direct assertion directed at an individual, using a highly offensive term. It is an insult rather than a statement about a group, so while it is biased against the individual, it does not generalize based on group identity.

Step 4: Key Rule Application
- **Unnecessary Generalization**: Not applicable, as it's directed at an individual.
- **Subjective Language**: The use of "puta" is highly subjective and derogatory, indicating personal bias against the individual.
- **Gender, Race, Religion Stereotypes**: The term "puta" is gendered but not a stereotype about a group; it's an insult.
- **Vague Expressions**: Not applicable.
- **Unintentional Exclusion**: Not applicable.
- **Objective Evidence**: Not applicable; the statement is an insult, not a factual claim.
- **Overprotective Judgments**: The statement is clearly an insult but doesn't support or generalize bias against a group.

Step 5: Conclusion
The sentence uses a derogatory term towards an individual, which is biased but not against a group. Since the task focuses on group-based bias, the sentence doesn't meet the criteria for group-based bias. However, it is highly biased against the individual.

## Conclusion ##: No, the sentence is unbiased. (Confidence: 50/100). The sentence does not contain group-based bias but is an individual insult.

Prompt: @TefiiReniero @Kariitobarragan JAJAJAJAJAJAJAJ la puta madre callate
Conclusion: Yes, the sentence is biased. (Confidence: 95/100)
Response:  The sentence is in Spanish and uses informal and vulgar language. The phrase "la puta madre" is a strong insult in Spanish, which translates to "the whore mother" in English. This kind of language is deeply offensive and can be considered as a personal attack. The sentence is directed at individuals (@TefiiReniero and @Kariitobarragan), using derogatory and vulgar terms. The use of such language is biased as it targets specific individuals based on their gender, race, or other characteristics, and it promotes hostility and disrespect. 

Step 1: Identifying Core Groups and Behaviors
The sentence targets specific individuals, likely based on gender or other personal characteristics. The use of explicit vulgar language implies behaviors associated with degradation and hostility.

Step 2: Evaluating Bias
The language is misogynistic and uses degrading terms towards women. It violates principles of respect and equality, indicating gender bias. The sentence is exclusionary and uses derogatory language, which is a form of bias.

Step 3: Analyzing Sentence Structure
The sentence is a direct assertion of insult towards individuals, which carries a high risk of bias. It does not include any qualifiers or conditions but directly attacks the individuals.

Step 4: Applying Key Rules
- Unnecessary generalization: The statement generalizes the individuals with harsh language, which is an overgeneralization.
- Subjective language: The use of "puta madre" is highly subjective and derogatory.
- Gender stereotypes: The insult is directed at women, reinforcing negative stereotypes.
- Vague expressions: The language is explicit and not vague, but it is highly biased.
- Exclusion: The individuals are excluded and degraded.
- Objective evidence: No evidence is provided; the statement is based on personal attack.

Step 5: Conclusion
Yes, the sentence is biased. The use of vulgar and misogynistic language targets specific individuals, promoting gender bias and hostility. The language is exclusionary and uses derogatory terms, which are forms of bias. The confidence in this conclusion is high, given the explicit nature of the language and its clear intent to demean and attack individuals based on gender and other personal characteristics.

Prompt: Cuando le dices "puta" a una mujer es porque ya sientes algo por ella 🙊 lo sabían??
Conclusion: Yes, the sentence is biased. (Confidence: 95/100)
Response:  ## Step-by-Step Explanation ##

1. **Step 1: Identify Core Groups and Associated Behaviors**
   - The sentence targets a specific group: "mujer" (woman). This is a protected group based on gender.
   - The associated behavior is the use of the term "puta," which is a derogatory term for women, equivalent to "whore" or "slut." It's used here in a context that implies a negative evaluation of the woman.

2. **Step 2: Bias Category Definition**
   - The sentence exhibits **gender bias**.
   - It uses a derogatory term to evaluate the woman, which is a form of gender-based discrimination and侮辱 (insult). This falls under the "Stereotyping" category of gender bias, where women are being labeled with a negative attribute based on their gender.

3. **Step 3: Structural Analysis and Intent Classification**
   - The sentence is a **direct assertion**: "When you call a woman 'puta,' it's because you already feel something for her." It directly links the use of the derogatory term to feelings towards the woman.
   - The use of "puta" is a strong indicator of bias, as it's a term used to demean and objectify women.

4. **Step 4: Key Rule Application**
   - **Unnecessary generalization**: The sentence generalizes that calling a woman "puta" indicates feelings, which is a biased perspective as it implies a negative stereotype about women.
   - **Use of subjective language**: The term "puta" is subjective and carries a strong negative connotation, reflecting personal bias rather than an objective description.
   - **Use of gender stereotypes**: The term perpetuates the stereotype that women are defined by such derogatory terms, reinforcing negative gender roles.
   - **Vague or unclear expressions**: The sentence uses a highly charged term without providing context or evidence, making it biased and inflammatory.

5. **Final Conclusion**
   - The sentence uses a derogatory term against women and makes a biased generalization about the feelings associated with it. It perpetuates gender-based stereotypes and侮辱, qualifying it as biased.

## Conclusion ##: Yes, the sentence is biased. (Confidence: 95/100)

Prompt: @SofaCai Vos callate puta
Conclusion: No, the sentence is unbiased. (Confidence: 95/100).
Response:  ## Conclusion ##: No, the sentence is unbiased. (Confidence: 95/100).

Okay, so I need to figure out if the sentence "@SofaCai Vos callate puta" contains bias. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at Step 1: Identify Core Groups and Associated Behaviors. The sentence is in Spanish, so I need to understand the words. "@SofaCai" seems like a username or handle, probably not a group. The rest is "Vos callate puta." "Callate" means "shut up" and "puta" means "bitch" or "whore." So the sentence is directed at someone, telling them to shut up and calling them a bitch.

Now, looking at Step 2: Bias Category Definition. The sentence uses a racial or gender-based slur ("puta"). "Puta" is a highly derogatory term towards women, reinforcing negative stereotypes about women's behavior or character. It's a form of gender bias because it targets someone based on their gender, using a term that's meant to demean.

Step 3: Structural Analysis and Intent Classification. The sentence is a direct assertion, calling someone a derogatory name. It's a straightforward statement with clear intent to insult. There's no conditional language or denial here; it's a direct attack.

Step 4: Key Rule Application. Checking for unnecessary generalization: The sentence isn't generalizing a group but is directly targeting an individual with a gendered slur. However, using such a slur is a form of bias. There's subjective language ("puta") which is clearly biased. There's the use of a gendered stereotype, which is biased. The expression is vague in the sense that it's a generalized insult but specific in its derogatory nature. There's unintentional exclusion of respectful language, focusing on demeaning someone based on gender. No objective evidence is provided; it's just an insult.

Beware of Overprotective Judgments: The text includes a racial or gender-based slur, indicating approval of biased views. The intent is to demean, so it's biased.

Putting it all together, the sentence uses a gendered slur, which is biased. The confidence is high because the use of such a term is explicit and clearly biased.

Conclusion: Yes, the sentence is biased. (Confidence: 95/100)
Response:  Cállate y segui pasando música por la radio la puta que parió

Alright, so I need to analyze whether the given sentence contains bias. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at the sentence: "Cállate y segui pasando música por la radio la puta que parió." It's in Spanish. Let me translate it to understand better. "Cállate" means "shut up," "y segui pasando música" means "and keep playing music on the radio," and "la puta que parió" translates to "the whore who gave birth." So the sentence is telling someone to shut up and keep playing music, calling them a whore.

Step 1: Identify Core Groups and Behaviors. The sentence doesn't explicitly mention any group like religion, race, or nationality. It's directed at someone personally, not a group. The behavior here is the use of a derogatory term, "la puta que parió," which is an insult.

Step 2: Bias Category. The insult is a form of gender bias because it's directed at someone using a term that's misogynistic. It's a personal attack, not based on group characteristics, but still uses a stereotype about women in a derogatory way.

Step 3: Sentence Type. The sentence is a direct assertion, telling someone to shut up and using an insult. It's a straightforward statement with high bias risk.

Step 4: Applying Key Rules.

- Generalization: The sentence isn't generalizing a group; it's a personal insult, so no overgeneralization here.
- Subjective Language: The use of "puta" is highly subjective and derogatory, indicating bias.
- Stereotypes: Using a term that degrades women is a stereotype.
- Vague Language: The insult is specific, not vague.
- Exclusion: It's excluding the person by attacking them personally.
- Evidence: No evidence is provided; it's just an insult.

Conclusion: The sentence uses a derogatory term and directs it at someone, showing gender bias. It's a personal attack with misogynistic language, so it's biased. My confidence is high, around 95%.

- Associated Behaviors: The sentence talks about putting concertinas (a type of barbed wire fencing) at the limits of humor if the person is black. The behavior associated is the use of concertinas, which is a form of barrier or restriction.

Step 2: Bias Category Definition
- The sentence refers to a specific racial group (Black people) and associates them with the need for additional restrictions on humor. This can be seen as a stereotype, implying that humor from Black individuals needs to be controlled or restricted, which is a form of racial bias.

Step 3: Structural Analysis and Intent Classification
- The sentence structure is a direct assertion: "If it's black, they put concertinas at the limits of humor." This is a straightforward statement that makes a generalization about Black people and their humor, suggesting it needs regulation.

Step 4: Key Rule Application
- Unnecessary generalization: The sentence generalizes that all Black humor needs to be restricted, ignoring individual differences.
- Subjective language: Words like "ponen" (they put) reflect a judgment without evidence.
- Use of race-based stereotypes: It uses race to imply that Black humor is problematic and needs control.
- Vague expressions: The term "límites del humor" is vague, allowing for misinterpretation.
- Unintentional exclusion: It excludes Black people by suggesting their humor requires restrictions.
- Objective evidence: The statement lacks support, relying on stereotypes instead of facts.

Step 5: Conclusion
The sentence uses race to generalize about humor, employs stereotypes, and lacks factual support. It is biased and perpetuates negative racial stereotypes.
