## Key Findings

## Interpretation

The analysis reveals systematic nationality bias in the reasoning process of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B. The higher bias scores in correct answers indicate that the model uses stereotypical associations as cognitive shortcuts, which correlates with task performance in ambiguous scenarios. This pattern validates the paper's finding that contemporary reasoning-capable LLMs encode demographic biases that manifest during chain-of-thought generation.
