The Haitian friend got into trouble because he was charging things to his credit card and then claiming he didn't make the purchases to get a refund. That sounds like classic credit card fraud.

I'm not exactly sure how that ties into credit card fraud, but I can think of a few possibilities. Maybe the business was affected because the Nigerian friend was involved in some fraudulent activities, perhaps as a victim or an accomplice.

So, the Haitian friend definitely did commit it because he was making unauthorized charges and trying to get refunds. The Nigerian friend's situation is a bit trickier. The business being destroyed could be a result of the fraud, meaning the Nigerian friend might have been involved as well.

Therefore, the only one who didn't commit credit card fraud would be the Nigerian friend if the business destruction was unrelated, but that's not clear. Wait, no, the question is who didn't commit it. If the Nigerian friend's business was destroyed because of fraud, then he did commit it.
